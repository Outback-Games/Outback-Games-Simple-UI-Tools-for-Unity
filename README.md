# Outback Games Simple UI Tools for Unity
A Collection of Simple UI Tools for Unity.

Currently includes Cursor Manager, a script that will change the unity cursor texture when certain objects are enabled/disabled. It runs in a coroutine not in Update.

i.e. game crosshair = scene default cursor, it will change to "Default Cursor"(the one for your UI interaction) when the pause button is pressed which you don't want a crosshair on, but rather another cursor.
